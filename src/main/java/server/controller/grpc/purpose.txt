/controller/grpc:

This directory is responsible for handling incoming gRPC requests, processing them, and returning the appropriate responses. Controllers can be thought of as the entry point for gRPC calls.
Contents:
gRPC Service Controllers: These classes would implement the generated gRPC service interfaces. They define the methods that handle the logic when a gRPC call is made.
Request/Response Handling: Any additional handling or processing logic specific to the gRPC calls can reside here.
